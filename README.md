<#TODO>
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE> 

#### Description:
This is a chat robot which works in user's command line.

It stores a variety of self care ideas, which are categorized in 8 different moods, in a file called data.py. Those moods are: happy, overwhelmed, stressed, anxious, sad, angry, tired, depressed, and excited.

In project.py, it prompts the user to enter what kind of mood she/he is in and provides user with a self care idea based on user's mood, and then ask the user whether user is satisfied with the idea provided or not. If not, then it will provide one more self care idea to user.

Also in data.py, there is a list of movies.
